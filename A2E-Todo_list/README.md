Title: Building a RESTful API with Authentication and Authorization

    Description:
    Develop a RESTful API using Python and a web framework of your choice (e.g., Flask, Django). Implement user authentication 
    and authorization mechanisms using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth. Utilize a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage. 
    Containerize the application using Docker and deploy it on a cloud platform such as AWS or Azure. Set up automated testing and 
    CI/CD pipelines using GitLab CI or Jenkins.
    
    Skills Practiced :
    
    - Python
    - Flask/Django
    - JWT/OAuth
    - Database integration (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
    - Docker
    - AWS/Azure

    My_Understanding :
    - Develop a Restful API using Python Flask    
    - Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT 
    - user MongoDB for data storage
    - Containerize the application using Docker
    - Deploy it in AWS ec2 -- install docker in ec2
    - Set up automated testing and ci/cd pipeline using jenkins
         - One ec2 instance we will have docker and jenkins --- for testing and build
         - another ec2 instance we will have docker and deployment level.

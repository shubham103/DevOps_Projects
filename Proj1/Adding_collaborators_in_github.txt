There are three steps
- adding the collaborator
- securing the master branch
   - no one will able to push a commit in master branch, code should only add through pull request after code review  by collaborators
- adding the Pull request rules



## Adding the collaborator

In git hub create a repository
Go to settings -> Access -> Collaborator -> invite user 
user will get the notification to accept the request. after that he will be able to use the repo for cloning and pushing. 


## Securing the master branch

Settings -> branches -> Branch Protection rules - > Require a pull request before merging


## adding the pull request rules 
 -set the minimum number of reviews required in the same setting above
 
 
 
 
 So the flow will be ..
 
user will create a new branch -> push the code in his branch -> create a pull request -> get the required reviews approvals -> merge the code in master branch -> delete the old branch 



using git tags we can maintain the versions of our software, like Major release and Minor release
